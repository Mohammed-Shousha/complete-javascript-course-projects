# Guess My Number

## Description

This project is a simple game where the user tries to guess a number between 1 and 20. The user enters a number in the input field and clicks the "Check!" button. The user is then notified if the number they entered is too high or too low. The user has 20 attempts to guess the correct number. If the user guesses the correct number, the background color of the page changes to green and the number is displayed in the "Number" field. If the user does not guess the correct number after 20 attempts, 'You lost the game!' is displayed in the "Message" field.
